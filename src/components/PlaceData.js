Sprawling in an area of 342239 sq km, Rajasthan is perfect for history buffs, culture aficionados, adventure lovers, wildlife enthusiasts, family vacations, honeymoon, and more.The major tourist attraction of Rajasthan are its havelis, palaces and forts that add to the experience of exploring one of the historically wealthy states in India.

It is the major tourist spot for most of the ornithologists today during hibernal season. Apart from these, Rajasthan is home to a large number of leopards, blackbuck, great Indian spotted eagle, and marsh crocodiles.",
        "Influenced with the parched region of Rajasthan, extreme climatic condition and limited availability of water and vegetation, the Rajasthani Cuisine has evolved out of the unique cooking style and pugnacious lifestyle of its natives. From the signature dish of the state; Dal Bati Churma to the popular street snack; mirchi ke pakore, from the generous use of spice and ghee to the prominent use of the variety of lentils and legumes, Rajasthani food is a fine treat for which the tourists travel even thousand miles.Starting from different kinds of breads like Batis, Missi roti, and Jowar, Bajra and Makke ki roti, to go with exceptionally tasty curries like Gatte ki Sabzi, Papad ki Sabzi and Kadhi Pakora. The pungent tidbits and accompaniments like Moong Dal and Pyaaz ki Kachori, Bikaneri Bhujia, Bajre ka khichda, Kher Sangri, and Lehsun ki Chutney, and the wind-up digestive Butter Milk elaborates the menu even more. And not to forget the sweet wonders like Churma, Lapsi, Malpua, Ghewar, Alwar ka Mawa and the long lasting Gond ke Laddoo. Though the region is predominantly vegetarian, the influence of Rajputs non-vegetarian food habit can be seen in the cuisine with the presence of delicacies such as Laal Maas, Jungle Maas, Khad Khargosh and Safed Maas, that in a way completes the menu.For luxury holidays, Rajasthan tourism has a decent number of heritage hotels that along with offering incredible hospitality to all its guests also cater to the fantasies of honeymoon couples. There are several ways that you can experience both luxury and royal hospitality in Rajasthan. One of these is taking a ride on the Royal Rajasthan on Wheels Train where you can sink into relaxing massage session; sample spicy Rajasthani cuisine in restaurant and bar-cum-lounge; relaxing stay in twin-bedded chambers with attached bathrooms and pampering session in the well-furnished salon, while enjoying the pretty view of the desert rolling by.We at Travelio want to help you explore this incredible land, and thus bring to you the best Rajasthan holiday packages at best prices.
